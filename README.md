# alz-class
A machine learning project with the goal of classifying different stages of Alzheimer's based on images

The jupyter notebook contains a VGG-16 model used to classify stages of Alzheimers. The 'val20_epochs50.h5' I loaded can be obtained by a link I will post soon. The weights are too big to be put on Github.
