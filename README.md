# alz-class
A machine learning project with the goal of classifying different stages of Alzheimer's based on images

The jupyter notebook contains a VGG-16 model used to classify stages of Alzheimers. Weights that I have trained can be downloaded from http://www.mediafire.com/file/jrf51v6ktj1qufb/file.

Try out the deployed model at HTTPS://alz-identifiers.herokuapp.com
